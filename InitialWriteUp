Plan of Action : 
The following project follows Agile Process Model to implement the software .  The core idea of the model is 
"  Individuals and interactions over processes and models  "
" Working Software over comprehensive Documentation  "
" Customer Collaboration over contract negotiations " 
" Responding to change over following a plan " 

So the main idea is to implement smaller chunks of the project in less time rather than planning it as a bigger task to be accomplished
over a large period of time . This not only assures of relaibility but also smaller risks involved here as failure here would mean a 
smaller chunk of it having a problem . 

Hence our project will be divided into smaller parts which will be shown in the design of the project .
